Advanced Trading Algorithm

License Python Status

An open-source trading algorithm designed for Indian retail investors, featuring real-time NSE data integration, portfolio risk analysis, technical indicators (RSI, SMA), backtesting, and voice-activated trading. Built with extensibility in mind, this project aims to integrate with Zerodha’s Kite Connect API to empower traders with actionable insights and automation.

Features

•	Real-Time NSE Data: Fetches live prices and volumes using nsepython (with plans for official NSE/BSE and Kite Connect integration).
•	Technical Indicators: Implements RSI (14-period) and SMA (50-period) via talib for trade signals.
•	Portfolio Analysis: Evaluates holdings, calculates risk (volatility), and suggests risk-adjusted trades.
•	Backtesting: Simulates strategy performance with slippage (0.1%) and transaction costs (0.01%).
•	Voice Trading: Execute trades via voice commands (e.g., “Buy 5 TCS” or “Sell 10 RELIANCE”).
•	Balance Sheet Fetching: Scrapes quarterly financials from Screener.in for fundamental analysis.
•	Modular Design: Easy to extend with new indicators, data sources, or features.


Strengths of the Code

1.  Real-Time Data Integration:
  •	The addition of NSE real-time data via nsepython shows an attempt to work with live market data, which is a critical feature for trading algos. This aligns with the need for 
  responsiveness in a competition setting.
2.	Portfolio Analysis:
	•	The analyze_portfolio and suggest_next_trade functions add a layer of personalization and risk management, which could appeal to judges looking for practical tools for retail 
  investors. Risk assessment based on volatility and suggesting trades based on risk tolerance is a solid feature.
3.	Technical Indicators and Backtesting:
	•	Using talib for RSI and SMA, combined with a backtesting module, demonstrates a data-driven approach to trading decisions. Backtesting with slippage and transaction costs adds 
  realism, which is a plus.
4.	Voice Command Feature:
	•	The voice-activated trading feature (voice_command_trading) is innovative and user-friendly, potentially standing out as a unique selling point (USP) in a competition. It caters to 
   accessibility and modern UI trends.
5.	Open-Source Libraries:
	•	Leveraging widely-used libraries like yfinance, pandas, and talib shows good use of community tools, aligning with the “floss” (free/libre open-source software) ethos if that’s part 
   of the competition’s focus.

below listed are the tasks and API's which will enhanced code

1.	Lack of Zerodha Kite Connect Integration:
	•	Zerodha’s ecosystem heavily relies on its Kite Connect API for real-time data, order placement, and portfolio management. Your code uses nsepython and yfinance instead, which might 
   be a significant drawback. For a Zerodha competition, integrating Kite Connect would be almost mandatory to fetch live data, execute trades, and manage portfolios directly through 
  their platform.
2.	Unofficial NSE Data Source:
	•	nsepython is an unofficial scraper and not a stable, officially supported API. Zerodha (and judges) might frown upon this due to reliability issues, potential rate limits, and 
   legal/compliance concerns. Official NSE/BSE data feeds or Kite Connect’s WebSocket API would be preferred.
3.	Execution Simulation:
	•	The code simulates trades (e.g., print(f"Bought {quantity} shares of {symbol}")) rather than executing real orders via a broker API. For a competition tied to Zerodha, actual order 
    placement via Kite Connect would demonstrate practical applicability.
4.	Scalability and Robustness:
	•	The caching mechanism (get_stock_history) uses local CSV files, which isn’t scalable for multiple users or symbols. A database (e.g., SQLite, Redis) would be more professional.
	•	Error handling is present but could be more comprehensive (e.g., handling API downtime, network issues).
5.	Compliance and Security:
	•	No mention of authentication, API keys, or secure handling of user data (e.g., portfolio details). For a Zerodha-related competition, compliance with SEBI regulations and secure API 
    usage would be critical.
6.	Limited Market Coverage:
	•	The code focuses on NSE stocks (e.g., .NS suffixes) and lacks support for other asset classes Zerodha offers (e.g., futures, options, commodities). A broader scope could strengthen 
    its appeal.
7.	Documentation and Modularity:
	•	While the code is functional, it lacks detailed comments, a README, or a clear structure for open-source contributions—key for a “floss” competition. Judges might expect better 
    documentation and modularity.

Enhancements which are possible by below mentioned KPI's

1.	Integrate Zerodha Kite Connect API:
	•	Replace nsepython and yfinance with Kite Connect for real-time data (kite.quote()), historical data (kite.historical_data()), and order placement (kite.place_order()).
	•	Example:
    from kiteconnect import KiteConnect
    kite =
  	KiteConnect(api_key="your_api_key")
    kite.set_access_token("your_access_token")
   def get_kite_realtime_data(symbol):
       quote = kite.quote(f"NSE:{symbol}")
       return quote[f"NSE:{symbol}"]
def place_trade(symbol, action, quantity):
    order_type = "BUY" if action == "Buy" else "SELL"
    kite.place_order(variety=kite.VARIETY_REGULAR, exchange="NSE", tradingsymbol=symbol,
                     transaction_type=order_type, quantity=quantity, product=kite.PRODUCT_CNC,
                     order_type=kite.ORDER_TYPE_MARKET)

	#	Register for Kite Connect 
2.	Replace Simulated Trades with Real Execution:
	•	Use place_trade in voice_command_trading to execute orders via Kite Connect instead of printing messages.
3.	Enhance Portfolio Management:
	•	Fetch real portfolio data from Kite (kite.holdings()) instead of hardcoding a dictionary.
	•	Example:
def get_portfolio():
    holdings = kite.holdings()
    return {h['tradingsymbol']: h['quantity'] for h in holdings}

4.	Improve Scalability:
	•	Use a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) for caching historical data:
import sqlite3
def save_to_db(df, symbol):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("trading_data.db")
    df.to_sql(symbol, conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
    conn.close()
5.	Add Compliance Features:
	•	Include API
